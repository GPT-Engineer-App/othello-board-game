# othello-board-game

Implement an Othello game board and pieces with the following:

- An 8x8 grid game board 
- Use green and white circles for the pieces
- Allow players to place pieces on the board by clicking
- Differentiate the two players' pieces by color
- Display the current player's turn at the top
- Add a "Pass" button to skip the current player's turn
- Center the board on the screen
- Use a clean, simple visual style

Don't add any game logic yet, just the basic board and piece placement.
